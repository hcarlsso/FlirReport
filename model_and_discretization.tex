\section{Model and discretization} \label{sec:model_disc}

Each pixel of an IR camera can be modeled as the circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
 \includegraphics[scale=0.31]{gfx/circuit.png}
\caption{Circuit schematic that model a pixel of the IR camera generated with \url{https://www.digikey.com/schemeit}.}
\label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}
More precisely the bolometer corresponds to the resistor R2. 

The pixel of the IR camera works as follow: a bias voltage is applied as square signal. The voltage is a piecewise constant function defined as 
\begin{align} \label{eq:Vb}
 V_b(t)&=\begin{cases} v_b & n t_f < t < n t_f + t_i \\
 0 &\mbox{ otherwise.} 
 \end{cases} && n \in {\mathbb N}
\end{align}
The readout signal is the voltage $V_{samp}$ across the capacitor C2 that we can express, by using the Kirchhoff's law, as
\begin{align} \label{eq:Vsamp_def}
 V_{samp} = 
 \frac{1}{\tilde C} \int_{n t_f}^{n t_f + t_i} \left( \frac{V_0}{R_S} - \frac{V_b(s)}{R(T(s))} \right) ds + E
\end{align}
where $R(T)$ is the value of the resistance of R2 as function of the temperature and $\tilde C$ is the capacitance of C2. In \cite{xiu2010research} this is modeled as $R(T)=R_S e^{\alpha(T-T_s)}$ where $\alpha$ is a constant that depends on the material of the bolometer. Clearly, in order to compute this integral, we need to know the temperature as function of the time. This relation is described  by the  \emph{heat balance equation} \eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation}.

The output signal can therefore be simulated in the following way. We set an initial temperature $T_0$ for the bolometer and solve the heat balance equation~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation}. Then we compute the integral describing the readout signal~\eqref{eq:Vsamp_def}.


\subsection{Illustrative example} \label{sec:example}
A reasonable and realistic simulation of the bolometer response can be obtained by solving the equations~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation}-\eqref{eq:Vsamp_def} with the parameters and coefficients given in Table~\ref{tab:par_coeffs_example}. Moreover we have set $T_0=T_s$, $P_t=A_s \sigma (T_0+10)^4$ and $P_s=A_s \sigma T_s^4$.


The solution of~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation} is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:solution_heat_balance_eq}. In the phase when the bias voltage is active, usually referred as \emph{integration time}, the temperature of the bolometer rises of circa $3K$. This is due to the fact that the current flowing through a component causes its overheat. When the bias voltage is not active, the temperature of the bolometer drops of circa $3K$, therefore we refer to this phase as \emph{cooling time}. See Figure~\ref{fig:solution_heat_balance_eq_splitted} for the illustration this such phenomena. The readout is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Vout}.

\label{fig:Vout}
\end{figure}

As we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:solution_heat_balance_eq}-\ref{fig:solution_heat_balance_eq_splitted}, the temperature of the bolometer does not only depend on the incoming IR radiation, namely the temperature of the object we are observing, but also on the bias voltage. In order to mitigate this phenomena, the frame-time $t_f$ is set much larger than the integration time $t_i$ to avoid overheat the bolometer. In particular the function temperature $T$ oscillates in the time (after very few pulses) around the temperature due to the incoming IR radiation. This also reflects in the readout, since $V_{samp}$ becomes constant, i.e., the bolometer has cached the temperature of the observed object.

\subsection{Numerical methods for simulating the bolometer}
The output signal can be simulated by setting an initial temperature for the bolometer and by solving the heat balance equation~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation}. The readout $V_{samp}$ corresponds to the integral~\eqref{eq:Vsamp_def} that can be approximated with any numerical integration algorithm such as Riemann sum, trapezoidal rule, etc. The equation~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation} cannot be solved naively with a numerical scheme for ODE described, e.g., in \cite{mattheij1996ordinary,ascher1998computer}. Namely, any \texttt{matlab} ODE solver is not capable of solving~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation}. This is due to the fact that the function $V_b(t)$ (bias voltage), defined in~\eqref{eq:Vb}, has a very fast variation. The strategy for effectively solve the problem consists in splitting the domain in sub-domains where $V_b(t)$ is constant. 

Assume that we want to solve~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation} for $0 \le t \le m t$ for a fixed $m \in \mathbb{N}$, namely we want $m$ pulses. The time domain can be split as
\begin{align*}
 [0, m t_f] = \bigcup_{k=0}^{m-1} (I_k \cup J_k)
\end{align*} 
where $I_k=[k t, k t_f+t_i]$ and $J_k = [k t_f + t_i, (k+1)t_f]$. 
We set $T_0(0):=T_0$ and for $k=1, 2, \dots$, we solve the ODE in $I_k$
\begin{align} \label{eq:heat_balance_equation_seq_bias}
& C\frac{dT_{k+1}}{dt}=\frac{v_b^2}{R(T_{k+1})}+\epsilon_e(P_t+P_s -2A\sigma T_{k+1}^4)-G_{leg}(T_{k+1}-T_s) \ , \ t \in I_k \nonumber \\
& T_{k+1}(kt_f)=T_{k}(kt_f)&
\end{align}
we set $\alpha:=T_{k+1}(kt_f+t_i)$ and we solve the ODE in $J_k$
\begin{align} \label{eq:heat_balance_equation_seq_no_bias}
& C\frac{dT_{k+1}}{dt}=\epsilon_e(P_t+P_s -2A\sigma T_{k+1}^4)-G_{leg}(T_{k+1}-T_s) \ , \ t \in J_k \nonumber \\
&T_{k+1}(kt_f+t_i)=\alpha_{k+1}	
\end{align}
The solution $T(t)$ of~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation} is obtained by gluing the functions $T_j(t)$, i.e., 
\begin{align*}
 T(t) = 
 \begin{cases}
  T_0(t) & t \in I_0 \cup J_0	\\
  T_1(t) & t \in I_1 \cup J_1	\\
	 & \vdots 		\\
  T_1(t) & t \in I_k \cup J_k	\\
	 & \vdots		\\
  T_m(t) & t \in I_m \cup J_m	\\
 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
In conclusion, the solutions of the ODEs~\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation_seq_bias}-\eqref{eq:heat_balance_equation_seq_no_bias} can be approximated with any numerical scheme such us Euler method, Runge--Kutta, etc. We did not observe any difficulty in solving these equations and we chose the explicit Euler method as solver since this can easily be extended to the noised model (stochastic differential equation) that we will introduce in the next section.
